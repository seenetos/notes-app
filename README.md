# Notes App

A simple full stack notes-taking app built as my first ever project on the journey to becoming a full stack developer.
Coding hours to date (7/24/2025) - Go easy on me.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: SQLite (via better-sqlite3)

## Features
- Add and view notes
- Local SQLite database for storage
- RESTful API with Express

## How to Run Locally
``bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
node app.js

# Frontend
Open frontend/index.html in your browser (use Live Server in VS Code)

## Still Learning

This is part of my personal learning roadmap. Coming next:
-  Login/Auth
-  Edit/Delete Notes
-  Full deployment to the web
